Due to the large size of the Zomato dataset, which consists of more than 2 lakhs of data points and exceeds 100MB in size, it is not feasible to upload the dataset directly to GitHub. As an alternative, a PDF version of the dataset has been uploaded, preserving the data integrity while adhering to GitHub's file size limit. The PDF file provides accessibility and readability for users interested in exploring the dataset's contents.
